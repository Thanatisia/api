## Information

This project derived from me needing to refer to some of my manuals and documentations, specifically during my linux ricing sessions and needing to refer to my FOSS masterlist. 
This idea led to the idea of making a [FOSS Masterlist JSON API](WebAPI/foss_pkgs.json) Web/JSON API to be used in my projects.

Thus, I came up with a repository to store all my APIs

At the moment, these are still a WIP and is technically considered in development, thus as such - *Your Mileage may Vary*

The API's versions will be recorded in the changelogs

If you would like to contribute to the project (Thank you in advance), please refer to my [CONTRIBUTING.md]("../CONTRIBUTING.md")
